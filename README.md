# Pneumonia Detection Model

This is a **Flask-based web application** designed to detect **pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using a **pre-trained deep learning model**. The app allows users to upload an X-ray image and receive predictions on whether the image indicates pneumonia or normal conditions. It also provides health-related facts and warnings for better user engagement.

## Model Overview
The prediction model was trained using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture implemented in **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model was trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images categorized into two classes:
- **Pneumonia**
- **Normal**

### Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains:
- **Training Images** : 5,216 images (split into pneumonia and normal classes).
- **Validation Images** : 1,600 images.
- **Testing Images** : 624 images.

### Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes:
- **Convolutional Layers** : Extract spatial features from the X-ray images.
- **Pooling Layers** : Reduce dimensionality while retaining important features.
- **Dense Layers** : Fully connected layers for classification.
- **Dropout Layers** : Prevent overfitting during training.

### Training Details
- **Optimizer** : Adam optimizer.
- **Loss Function** : Binary Crossentropy.
- **Epochs** : 20 epochs.
- **Batch Size** : 32.

## Accuracy
After training and testing the model, the final performance metrics achieved were:
- **Training Accuracy** : ~%
- **Validation Accuracy** : ~56%
- **Testing Accuracy** : **62%**

The model demonstrates good generalization and can reliably classify X-ray images into **pneumonia** or **normal** categories.
